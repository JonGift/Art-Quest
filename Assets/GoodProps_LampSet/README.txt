How to use the switch light script:
1. Select the lamp and go in the inspector, find the SwitchLight script*
and check the check box "IsLightOn" if you want to switch it on
2. Play the scene, it works!

*The material of each lamp includes an emissive texture to give a realistic lights effect
The SwitchLight script allows switching on/off both the emissive texture and the Point light in the lamp.
